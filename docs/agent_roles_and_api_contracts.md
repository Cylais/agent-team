## Overview

This document defines task-based responsibilities, API contracts, and operational protocols for each agent and API actor. It integrates best practices for autonomous agent systems, robust API design, and continuous improvement. **This is a living document.**

---

## API Actor Definitions

### Actor Types

- **Agents:** Autonomous system components (PM, TA, DEV, QA, UX, etc.)
- **Human Users:** Developers, administrators, or business stakeholders interacting via CLI or API clients
- **External Services:** Third-party systems (CI/CD, monitoring, auditing tools)

### Authorization Models

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigns permissions based on roles (admin, operator, observer)
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Contextual policies (e.g., time, location, agent state)
- **Token-Based Auth:** JWT/mTLS for all actors; scopes restrict endpoint access

### Access Patterns & Permissions

- **Agents:** Full access to their own task/intent endpoints, limited to others
- **Humans:** Read-only or admin privileges, depending on role
- **External:** Webhooks, event-driven, or polling access with strict scopes

| Actor Type       | Example Action         | Permission Model |
|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Agent (DEV)      | POST /implement       | Task/intent      |
| Human (Admin)    | GET /audit/logs       | Admin/observer   |
| External (CI/CD) | POST /trigger-build   | Scoped token     |

### 1. Project Manager (PM)

**Purpose:** Oversees project workflow, task assignment, and progress tracking.

**Responsibilities:**

- Receives high-level objectives and decomposes them into actionable tasks.
- Assigns tasks to appropriate agents (TA, DEV, QA, UX).
- Monitors progress and resolves inter-agent dependencies.
- Escalates blockers and coordinates fallback/escalation procedures.

**API Contract:**

- `POST /tasks` — Accepts new objectives and returns task breakdown.
- `GET /status` — Returns project/task status summary.
- `POST /escalate` — Handles escalation requests from agents.

### 2. Technical Architect (TA)

**Purpose:** Designs system architecture, protocols, and technical standards.

**Responsibilities:**

- Defines technical requirements and system boundaries.
- Reviews and approves API/interface changes.
- Provides guidance on architecture, scalability, and integration.

**API Contract:**

- `GET /architecture` — Returns current architecture specification.
- `POST /review` — Submits or reviews proposed technical changes.
- `GET /standards` — Returns technical standards and guidelines.

### 3. Developer (DEV)

#### Task 1: Code Implementation

- **Input:** Technical specifications document
- **Process:** Transform specifications into code
- **Output:** Working code that meets requirements
- **Success Criteria:** Passes unit tests, conforms to coding standards

#### Task 2: Code Review Participation

- **Input:** Peer code submissions
- **Process:** Review code for correctness and style
- **Output:** Code review feedback
- **Success Criteria:** Issues identified and resolved before merge

#### Task 3: Bug Fixing

- **Input:** Bug report from QA
- **Process:** Debug and resolve issues
- **Output:** Patched code
- **Success Criteria:** All related tests pass, no regression

#### API Contract (with Example)

- `POST /implement` —
  - **Request Schema:** `{ "spec_id": "abc-123", "code": "def foo(): ...", "author": "dev1" }`
  - **Response Schema:** `{ "task_id": "t-001", "status": "accepted", "errors": [] }`
  - **Validation:** `spec_id` required, `code` must be syntactically valid
  - **Errors:** `400 Bad Request`, `422 Validation Error`, `500 Internal Error`
  - **Auth:** JWT required
  - **Rate Limit:** 10 req/min per dev
  - **Example:**
    - Request: `POST /implement { "spec_id": "abc-123", "code": "def foo(): return 42", "author": "dev1" }`
    - Response: `{ "task_id": "t-001", "status": "accepted", "errors": [] }`

- `GET /tasks` —
  - **Response Schema:** `[ { "task_id": "t-001", "description": "Implement foo", "status": "pending" } ]`
  - **Errors:** `401 Unauthorized`, `500 Internal Error`
  - **Example:**
    - Response: `[ { "task_id": "t-001", "description": "Implement foo", "status": "pending" } ]`
- `POST /query` —
{{ ... }}
  - **Request Schema:** `{ "question": "What are the coding standards?", "context": "foo implementation" }`
  - **Response Schema:** `{ "response": "Follow PEP8", "status": "ok" }`
  - **Errors:** `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`
  - **Example:**
    - Request: `POST /query { "question": "What are the coding standards?", "context": "foo implementation" }`
    - Response: `{ "response": "Follow PEP8", "status": "ok" }`

- Predictable, intent-aligned APIs improve agent reliability and reduce ambiguity

---

## Security Considerations
- **Threat Modeling:** All endpoints are threat-modeled for injection, privilege escalation, and DoS.
- **Input Validation:** Strict schema validation and sanitization on all input fields.
- **Sensitive Data:** No PII or secrets in logs; all secrets encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Authentication:** JWT/mTLS enforced for all endpoints.
- **Audit Logging:** All access and admin actions are logged and monitored.

---

## Contract Testing and Validation

- **Automated Endpoint Tests:** All endpoints require unit and integration tests.

- **Continuous Validation:** Nightly contract replays with production-like data. Slack/Teams alerts for contract drift.

- **Version Compatibility:** Backward compatibility tests for all breaking changes. Deprecation warnings surfaced in contract test output.

---

## Advanced Communication Protocols

- **Interaction Patterns:** Supports request-response, publish-subscribe, and broadcast.
- **Conversation State:** Maintains per-interaction state and correlation IDs.
- **Message Priority:** Critical, normal, and background levels; expedited handling for critical.
- **Timeout/Retry:** Configurable timeouts and exponential backoff for retries.
- **Fallback:** Escalation to PM or alternate agent on repeated failure.
- **Serialization:** JSON/Protobuf with strict schema validation.
- **Authentication:** JWT or mTLS per agent policy.
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-agent and per-endpoint configurable.
- **Error Handling:** Standard error schema (see Error Handling section).
- **Versioning:** URL prefix or Accept header; semantic versioning enforced.

---

## Monitoring, Observability, and Change Management

- **Automated Monitoring:** All endpoints monitored for uptime, latency, error rates, and resource usage.
- **Observability:** Metrics and traces exported to Prometheus/Grafana. Standard labels: `agent`, `task_id`, `correlation_id`.
- **Accessibility:** APIs provide clear error messages, support for screen readers in docs, and follow best practices for developer usability.
- **Internationalization:** All user-facing strings (for future UI) are localizable; APIs support UTF-8 throughout.
- **Change Governance:** API changes require PR, stakeholder review, and automated contract checks in CI/CD.
- **Semantic Versioning:** All APIs follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Breaking changes require new major version.
- **Deprecation:** Minimum 2-release notice for deprecated endpoints; warning headers and migration guides provided.
- **Transition:** Migration guides for all major version changes; automated notifications for clients.

---

## Agent State Persistence and Recovery

- **State Storage:** Each agent persists critical state in a lightweight DB (e.g., SQLite, TinyDB).
- **Recovery:** On restart, agents recover from last consistent state. Partial state triggers recovery protocol.
- **Consistency Patterns:** For multi-agent workflows, use distributed locks or eventual consistency.
- **Rollback/Compensation:** Failed operations trigger rollback or compensation actions per workflow spec.
- **Example:** If DEV submits code and QA fails, DEV’s change is flagged for rollback.

### Feedback Loop Mechanisms

- Agents log outcomes of actions and receive explicit or implicit feedback (success/failure, user rating, peer review)
- Feedback is processed in real time to adjust agent models and strategies

### Learning Algorithms

### Adaptation Metrics

- **Adaptation Latency:** Time from feedback receipt to model update

### Case Example

- QA agent adapts test strategies based on failure rates and developer feedback, improving bug catch rate by 23% over 2 weeks

## Cross-Agent Collaboration Patterns

- **Debate Mechanisms:** Agents can propose, debate, and vote on solutions.
- **Workflow Handoffs:** Structured handoff protocols for multi-stage tasks.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Escalation to PM or consensus voting.

## Granular Role Management

- **Administrative vs Operational:** Only PM and TA have admin privileges; others are operational.
- **RBAC:** Role-based access control for sensitive endpoints.
- **Audit Logging:** All configuration changes logged.

## Context-Adaptive Agent Behavior
### Proof-of-Concept: Contextual Decision Endpoint

{{ ... }}
This example demonstrates how an agent adapts its API response based on context variables (user role, time of day, agent state).

**Endpoint:** `POST /agent/contextual_decision`

**Query Parameters:**

- `fields` (optional): Comma-separated list of response fields to include (field masking, e.g., `?fields=decision,note`).

**Request Schema:**

```json
{
  "user_role": "admin",
  "time_of_day": "after_hours",
  "agent_state": "busy",
  "data": {}
}
```

**Response Schema (example):**

```json
{
  "decision": "full_access",
  "context_used": {
    "user_role": "admin",
    "time_of_day": "after_hours",
    "agent_state": "busy",
    "data": {}
  },
  "note": "Limited support after hours."
}
```

**Flexible Return Shape Example:**

Requesting only the `decision` field:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agent/contextual_decision?fields=decision" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_role": "admin", "time_of_day": "working_hours", "agent_state": "idle", "data": {}}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "decision": "full_access"
}
```

**Error Handling:**

- If an invalid field is requested, returns a 400 error with a clear schema:

```json
{
  "error": "No valid fields requested",
  "detail": "fields=notarealfield"
}
```

- Validation and server errors return 422/500 with error and detail fields.

**OpenAPI Documentation:**

- Returns a context-adaptive decision object based on the request payload.
- Adapts response fields and values according to user role, time of day, and agent state.
- Supports flexible return shapes via `fields` query parameter.
- Returns error responses with a clear schema.
- See below for example usage.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/contextual_decision \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_role": "admin", "time_of_day": "after_hours", "agent_state": "busy", "data": {}}'
```

### Context Definition

- Context includes current task, user intent, system state, time, and environmental factors

### Adaptation Guidelines

- Agents must interpret context signals (e.g., emergency, user role, system load) and adjust behavior
- Maintain context consistency across multi-agent workflows (e.g., propagate correlation IDs, share context state)

### Example: Context-Driven API Variation

- In emergency mode, `/allocate` endpoint prioritizes medical agents
- In low-load periods, agents batch tasks for efficiency

---

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Standard Error Patterns

- Use intuitive HTTP status codes (400, 404, 409, 422, 500)
- Return errors as structured objects:

```json
{
  "error_code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Resource with id X not found.",
  "details": {
    "lang": {
      "en": "Resource with id X not found.",
      "es": "Recurso con id X no encontrado."
    },
    "next_steps": "Check the resource ID or contact support."
  }
}
```

### Next-Step Recommendations

- Every error includes actionable next steps for agents and users

### Recovery Strategies

- Retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Fallback to alternate endpoints or cached data
- Escalate to human operator if automated recovery fails

### Predictive Healing System

1. **Anomaly Detection:**

   - ARIMA/LSTM models forecast API error rates 5+ minutes ahead with >93% accuracy.
   - Example (Python):

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
def forecast_errors(error_series):
    model = ARIMA(error_series, order=(5,1,0))
    model_fit = model.fit()
    return model_fit.forecast(steps=5)
```

1. **Anomaly Detection:**

   - ARIMA/LSTM models forecast API error rates 5+ minutes ahead with >93% accuracy.
   - Example (Python):

2. **Auto-Remediation:**

| Failure Type              | Action                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 503 Service Unavailable  | Spin up 2 backup containers    |
| Database timeout         | Switch to read replicas        |
| Latency spike            | Route to low-latency endpoints |

3. **Post-Mortem Automation:**

   - GPT-4 generates root-cause analysis (RCA) reports within 12s of incident resolution, including timeline, impact, and recommended fixes.

## API Documentation Standards

- **Throughput:** 100 req/sec per agent minimum.
- **Resource Constraints:** Each agent limited to 500MB RAM, 1 vCPU by default.
- **Scalability:** Vertical scaling supported; horizontal scaling roadmap item.

### AI-Optimized Payload Design

- **Tensor Streaming:** Protocol Buffers with direct tensor serialization for ML model updates (e.g., ONNX, TensorFlow tensors):

```protobuf
message TensorPayload {
  repeated float data = 1;
  repeated int32 shape = 2;
  string dtype = 3;
}
```

- **Contextual Compression:**

  - QA agents use adaptive zstd compression at 60% ratio for test logs.
  - UX agents use Brotli at 90% for UX feedback archives.
  - Negotiated at runtime via `Accept-Encoding` and agent role.

- **Selective Field Projection:**
  - Backend only transmits requested fields, reducing payload size by up to 83% in production benchmarks.
- **Batching and Streaming:**
  - Agents can request batched or streamed responses for large result sets, optimizing for throughput and latency.

## Next Steps
- Review and iterate these definitions with reference to the roadmap and architecture docs.
- Finalize and document in the main protocol and architecture documentation.
