# Agent Governance, Change Control, and Acceptance Criteria

## Governance Structure
- **Steering Committee:** PM and TA review all scope changes and major capability additions.
- **Sprint Reviews:** All agents participate in sprint reviews and retrospectives to validate progress and surface issues.
- **Change Requests:**
  - Any agent or stakeholder may submit a change request.
  - Requests are logged, reviewed weekly, and prioritized by the steering committee.
- **Scope Boundaries:**
  - Each agentâ€™s in-scope and out-of-scope responsibilities are reviewed at sprint start.
  - Out-of-scope requests are redirected or escalated per agent boundaries.
