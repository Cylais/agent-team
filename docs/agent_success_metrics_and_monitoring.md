# Agent Success Metrics and Monitoring Framework

## Overview
Defines leading and lagging indicators, per-agent metrics, monitoring dashboards, and feedback loops for continuous improvement.

---

## Metrics Types
- **Leading Indicators:**
  - Task throughput, response latency, code/test coverage, prompt accuracy
  - Escalation frequency, feedback loop completion rate
- **Lagging Indicators:**
  - Delivered features, bug counts, stakeholder satisfaction, project velocity
  - Agent learning/improvement over time

## Per-Agent Metrics (with SLAs)

| Agent | Metric                    | SLA/Threshold              |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| PM    | On-time delivery          | >95% milestones on time    |
| PM    | Risk mitigation           | <2 unresolved risks/sprint |
| PM    | Stakeholder engagement    | >90% satisfaction score    |
| TA    | Architectural compliance  | >98% design adherence      |
| TA    | API quality               | <2 major issues/release    |
| TA    | Security incidents        | 0 critical incidents       |
| DEV   | Feature completion        | >90% sprint completion     |
| DEV   | Code quality              | <1.5 code smells/1000 LOC  |
| DEV   | Review turnaround         | <24h for PR reviews        |
| QA    | Test coverage             | >85% automated coverage    |
| QA    | Defect detection rate     | >95% of critical bugs pre-release |
| QA    | Regression cycle time     | <2 days                    |
| UX    | User feedback scores      | >4.0/5.0                   |
| UX    | Accessibility compliance  | 100% WCAG 2.1 AA           |
| UX    | A/B test impact           | >5% improvement/experiment |

## Monitoring Dashboards
- Real-time metrics for all agents (Grafana, Prometheus, custom UI)
- Visualizations: Line/bar charts for trends, heatmaps for escalations, pie charts for SLA compliance, agent-specific dashboards.
- Escalation events and agent health tracked continuously
- Alerts for performance degradation, missed SLAs, or excessive escalations

## Feedback Loops
- Sprint reviews and retrospectives: Underperforming metrics are discussed and assigned improvement actions.
- Automated monitoring triggers improvement plans if metrics fall below SLA for 2 consecutive sprints.
- Stakeholder surveys and agent self-reports feed into improvement cycles.

## Benchmarking
- Compare agent performance to human expert baselines
- Track progress toward quick-win and long-term objectives

## Continuous Improvement
- Underperforming metrics trigger agent improvement plans
- Metrics and dashboards evolve as agent roles mature

## Changelog
- **2025-04-21:** Added SLAs, visual suggestions, feedback loop clarifications, and metrics tables.
