# Agent Memory Models

This document outlines the memory structures and evolution for each agent, supporting robust context, learning, and collaboration.

---

## Memory Types (per Agent)
- **Short-Term Context:**
  - Holds current tasks and recent actions, volatile and quickly updated.
  - *Example:* QA agent remembers last 10 regression tests and their outcomes.
- **Episodic Memory:**
  - Logs major events with timestamps, forming a project/task history.
  - *Example:* DEV agent logs bug #1034 as resolved on 2025-04-15; PM logs a resolved scheduling conflict on 2025-04-12.
- **Semantic Memory:**
  - Stores best practices, reusable patterns, and domain knowledge in a structured, indexed form.
  - *Example:* TA agent documents API security guideline; DEV agent saves a code refactoring pattern.
- **Procedural Memory:**
  - Step-by-step workflows, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and checklists, versioned over time.
  - *Example:* PM agent updates the sprint planning protocol; QA agent references the release testing workflow.

*Short-term feeds into episodic; episodic informs semantic/procedural; knowledge networks link across agents.*

## Memory Organization
- **Dynamic Indexing:**
  - Agents reorganize and link memories based on relevance and context. When a QA agent finds a recurring bug pattern, dynamic indexing links this with semantic and episodic memory, improving future detection.
- **Zettelkasten Method:**
  - Interconnected notes with bidirectional links, allowing traceable knowledge evolution. For example, a TA agent links a new API design note to several related security best practices.
- **Knowledge Networks:**
  - Cross-agent linking for shared context and collaboration. DEV and QA agents share lessons learned from a failed deployment, enabling both to update their semantic and episodic memories.
- **Contextual Evolution:**
  - New memories can trigger updates to related historical memories. If a new workflow is adopted, all related procedural memories are updated and versioned.

---

## Cross-Agent Memory Governance
- **What’s Shared:**
  - Only "lessons learned", "approved patterns", and non-sensitive best practices are shared by default.
- **Permission Models:**
  - Role-based access controls ensure agents can only access or update allowed memory segments. For example, UX can see but not edit DEV’s code patterns.
- **Privacy and Collaboration:**
  - Sensitive data is never shared without explicit approval. All cross-agent sharing is logged and reviewed during audits.
- **Collaboration Gains:**
  - Sharing enables faster onboarding, reduces repeated mistakes, and improves overall agent intelligence.

---

## Storage & Retrieval
- **Specialized DBs:**
  - Risk registry (PM), stakeholder models (PM), API registry (TA), test result DB (QA), user feedback DB (UX)
- **Versioning:**
  - All memory changes are versioned for traceability (e.g., using Postgres with audit tables, or Git-like versioning).
- **APIs:**
  - Unified API for storing, retrieving, and linking memories across agents.
- **Technology Suggestions:**
  - Graph DBs (Neo4j, ArangoDB) for knowledge networks and Zettelkasten.
  - Postgres for versioned logs and structured data.
  - Pinecone or Qdrant for vectorized semantic memory.

---

## Governance
- **Access Control:**
  - Role-based permissions for memory access and updates, enforced at the DB and API layer.
- **Audit Trails:**
  - All changes logged for compliance and improvement. Audit logs are stored in immutable storage.
- **Continuous Review:**
  - Memory audits are conducted every 2 sprints (or monthly, whichever is sooner).
  - If audit issues are found, the steering committee reviews and escalates to the responsible agent for correction within the next sprint.
