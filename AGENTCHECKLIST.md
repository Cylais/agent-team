# Agent Modernization Checklist

This document tracks the modernization status of all agents against the Phase 2 Enterprise-Grade enhancements.

## PM Agent Modernization Checklist
- [x] Async Redis with connection pooling (`redis.asyncio`)
- [x] Circuit breaker pattern for Redis operations
- [x] Bulkhead isolation for Redis connections (docker-compose resource limits)
- [x] JWT validation overhaul (`python-jose`), shared AuthService
- [x] API rate limiting (fastapi-limiter)
- [x] Redis pipelining for batch updates
- [x] Connection pool tuning (max_connections, keepalive, retry)
- [x] Prometheus metrics instrumentation
- [x] OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- [x] Context-aware task creation (AI hints)
- [x] Semantic/ML-based conflict resolution
- [x] API contract testing (Pact)
- [x] Chaos engineering hooks for Redis/API
- [x] Production Dockerfile optimization
- [x] GitOps/ArgoCD deployment manifest

- [x] Bulkhead isolation for Redis connections (asyncio.Semaphore)
- [x] JWT validation overhaul (`python-jose`), shared AuthService

- [x] Prometheus metrics instrumentation
- [ ] OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- [ ] Context-aware task creation (AI/semantic hints endpoint is a placeholder)
