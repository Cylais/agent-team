# Unified Roadmap for a 5-Agent Autonomous Development Team

## Scaling Constraints & Right-Sizing

- **Target Scale:** Up to 10 agents and 5 users maximum.
- **Data Storage:** Use lightweight, embedded, or small managed databases (e.g., SQLite, TinyDB, minimal Postgres).
- **Memory/Vector DB:** Local or free-tier managed vector DBs only; no need for distributed or clustered storage.
- **User Management:** Simple authentication/authorization; no enterprise IAM or multi-tenant complexity.
- **Orchestration:** All agents and services designed to run efficiently on a single server or small VM.
- **Monitoring/Backup:** Lightweight, local, or free-tier cloud solutions for metrics and backups.
- **Deployment:** No need for Kubernetes or large-scale infra; defaults are lean and modular.
- **Upgrade Path:** Architecture allows for future scaling, but all defaults are intentionally right-sized for this scope.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (with Backup System)

### 1.1 System Design [x]

- **Central Orchestration Layer**: Windsurf (Cascade) for workflow, agent registration, and task orchestration.
- **Distributed Specialized Agents**: Five agents, each with clear boundaries and tailored memory models.
- **Shared Context Layer**: Unified memory (short-term, episodic, semantic, procedural) in a vector DB (Pinecone/Qdrant), accessible via a secure API.

### 1.2 Communication Protocols [x]

- **Standardized JSON/Protobuf Messaging**: Schema with sender, recipient, content, metadata, and priority.
- **Event-Driven Message Bus**: Async and sync patterns (Kafka, NATS, or Redis Streams).
- **Hierarchical & Peer Channels**: PM as coordinator, direct agent-to-agent for specialized tasks.
- **Message Prioritization**: Critical tasks flagged for expedited handling.

### 1.3 Tool Integration [x]

- **API Gateway**: Unified access to Cascade, Sonar, and custom tools.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control for tools and memory.
- **Tool Registry & Observability**: Central catalog and monitoring dashboard.

### 1.4 Backup & Disaster Recovery System [x]

- **Automated, Incremental Backups**: Regular snapshots of all agent memory, project context, and system state to secure, redundant storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage).
- **Versioned Backups**: Every critical change triggers a versioned backup, allowing rollback to any prior state.
- **Disaster Recovery Playbooks**: Documented procedures for restoring system state, agent memory, and ongoing workflows with minimal downtime.
- **Integrity Checks**: Automated verification of backup completeness and integrity.
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized agents/processes can trigger restores or access backup data.

## End of Roadmap

**Note:** This architecture is intentionally lean and right-sized for a maximum of 10 agents and 5 users. All technology choices and infrastructure are kept minimal to avoid overengineering, while still supporting modular upgrades if needed in the future.
This unified roadmap merges operational depth and memory models with architectural clarity, measurable outcomes, and extensibility. It’s designed for robust, scalable, and adaptive multi-agent development across all major platforms. The backup system ensures no loss of critical data or context throughout the project lifecycle.
