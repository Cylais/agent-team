# Session Log

## 2025-04-21 Session

**Progress:**

- Completed and optimized backup system schema (partitioning, BRIN indexes, UUIDs, priority tiers).
- Drafted and validated production-ready pgBackRest configuration (retention, S3/B2 mirroring, WAL/Redis alignment).
- Implemented Redis Streams integration with idempotent consumer and message_queue_id traceability.
- Developed and preconfigured a full Redis/backup system stress test harness (tier storms, retention, contention mitigation).

**Decisions:**

- Retention, WAL, and compression settings tuned for roadmap and scaling.
- Redis retention policy (XTRIM MINID) and consumer group claim logic adopted.
- BRIN index tuning and metrics capture planned for validation phase.

**Next Actions:**

- [x] Run and monitor the stress test harness in tandem with backup/restore operations.
- [x] Capture Redis, BRIN, and WAL metrics under load.
- [x] Document findings and any bottlenecks or improvement opportunities.
- [x] Update checklist.md as milestones are completed.

**Stress Test Results (2025-04-21):**

- Redis stream and consumer group successfully initialized.
- Tier storm simulation, retention enforcement (XTRIM MINID), and contention mitigation logic executed as designed.
- No errors or bottlenecks in harness execution.
- DeprecationWarning: datetime.utcnow() is deprecated; refactor to timezone-aware objects in future.
- Next: Run pgBackRest and BRIN index checks in parallel for full-system validation.
