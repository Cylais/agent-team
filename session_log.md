## 2025-04-21 Session

**Phase 2 Initiation and Immediate Actions:**

- Updated roadmap and checklist to reflect enhanced Phase 2 plan, with explicit sub-phases and actionable tasks.
- Created foundational documentation:
  - `docs/agent_roles_and_boundaries.md`: Roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths for PM, TA, DEV, QA, UX.
  - `docs/agent_communication_protocol.md`: JSON message schema, API contracts, orchestration logic, fallback/escalation, monitoring.
  - `docs/agent_day_in_life_scenarios.md`: Typical daily workflows, collaboration, and escalation for each agent.
  - `docs/agent_memory_models.md`: Short-term, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory; Zettelkasten and knowledge networks; governance.
  - `docs/agent_governance_and_acceptance.md`: Change control, steering committee, acceptance criteria, and template.
  - `docs/agent_success_metrics_and_monitoring.md`: Leading/lagging metrics, per-agent KPIs, dashboards, feedback loops, benchmarking.
- All foundational docs and plans created on 2025-04-21 to support robust, agile, and scalable agent development.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin code scaffolding for agent communication orchestration and memory models.
- Track progress in checklist and update session log with implementation milestones.

## 2025-04-21 Session

**Documentation Enhancement Milestone:**

- Completed major enhancements to `agent_roles_and_api_contracts.md`:
  - API actor definitions (agents, humans, external services, RBAC/ABAC, access patterns)
  - Context-adaptive agent behavior
  - Expanded contract testing and validation (consumer-driven, CI/CD, test cases)
  - Intent-aligned, composable endpoints
  - Flexible return shapes (GraphQL-like, field masking)
  - Enhanced learning/adaptation (feedback, metrics, case studies)
  - API documentation standards (OpenAPI/Swagger)
  - Advanced error handling (schemas, multilingual, recovery)

**Next Steps:**
- Review and standardize documentation
- Update checklist and roadmap_unified.md
- Begin proof-of-concept implementation for context adaptation or flexible return shapes

---

**Stress Test Results (2025-04-21):**

- Redis stream and consumer group successfully initialized.
- Tier storm simulation, retention enforcement (XTRIM MINID), and contention mitigation logic executed as designed.
- No errors or bottlenecks in harness execution.
- DeprecationWarning: datetime.utcnow() is deprecated; refactor to timezone-aware objects in future.
- Next: Run pgBackRest and BRIN index checks in parallel for full-system validation.

## 2025-04-21 Session (Evening)

**Milestone: Phase 2A Mock/Test Interfaces Complete**

- Implemented and validated all required mock/test API endpoints for agent system:
  - `/agent/send` (instruction ingestion)
  - `/agent/build_status` (build status webhook)
  - `/agent/session_control` (session control)
- Endpoints tested and confirmed operational via both Swagger UI and curl (Windows).
- Checklist updated to mark this milestone as complete.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin development of the API compatibility and reliability test suite (schema validation, error handling, stress scenarios).
- Continue tracking progress and documenting decisions in session_log.md and checklist.md.

## 2025-04-21T20:08:43+01:00 – PM Agent Phase 2 Modernization Complete

## 2025-04-21T20:28:18+01:00 – TA Agent Modernization In Progress
- TA agent: async Redis, circuit breaker, bulkhead, async endpoints, batch ops, AI/semantic placeholder, rate limiting, JWT, Prometheus metrics/tracing (in progress)
- Checklist updated
- Next: expand tests, complete observability, finalize docs


- PM Agent fully modernized:
  - Batch Redis pipelining
  - AI/semantic task hints
  - Semantic conflict resolution
  - API rate limiting
  - Contract testing (Pact)
  - Observability (metrics/tracing)
  - Documentation and linting
- All checklist and roadmap items for PM Agent are DONE

**Next Steps:**
- Begin modernization for TA, QA, UX agents (same checklist/process)
- Continuous documentation (README, checklist, roadmap, session log)
- Quality gates: run/verify all tests and lint compliance


---

## 2025-04-21 Session (Late Afternoon)

- Enhanced `/agent/contextual_decision` endpoint to support flexible return shapes (field masking via `fields` query param) and robust error handling (clear error schemas for invalid field requests, validation, and server errors).
- Updated `agent_roles_and_api_contracts.md` with new usage, schema, and error handling documentation.
- Expanded automated tests to cover flexible return shapes and error scenarios—all passing.
- Checklist and roadmap updated to reflect completion of these features.

**Next Steps:**
- Add further edge-case tests for the endpoint (e.g., missing/extra fields, malformed payloads, unicode/large input, etc.).
- Refine implementation and documentation for clarity and completeness.
- Continue to polish API and error handling patterns as needed.
