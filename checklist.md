- [x] JWT validation overhaul (`python-jose`), shared AuthService
- [x] API rate limiting (fastapi-limiter)
- [x] Redis pipelining for batch updates
- [x] Connection pool tuning (max_connections, keepalive, retry)
- [x] Prometheus metrics instrumentation
- [x] OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- [x] Context-aware task creation (AI hints)
- [x] Semantic/ML-based conflict resolution
- [x] API contract testing (Pact)
- [x] Chaos engineering hooks for Redis/API
- [x] Production Dockerfile optimization
- [x] GitOps/ArgoCD deployment manifest

## Phase 2 Checklist
- [x] Document system boundaries in project_architecture.md
- [x] Complete agent_communication_protocol.md with serialization, error handling, versioning
- [x] Implement mock interfaces for instruction ingestion, build status webhook, and session control  
  _Completed 2025-04-21. Endpoints validated via Swagger UI and curl (Windows)._
- [x] Establish compatibility and reliability test suite for API layer

### 2A: Foundation
- [ ] Define agent roles, boundaries, and standardized communication protocols
    - [ ] Draft detailed role descriptions for each agent (PM, TA, DEV, QA, UX)
    - [ ] Specify agent boundaries and responsibilities
    - [ ] Draft standardized communication protocols (message formats, API contracts)
    - [ ] Review and iterate role and protocol drafts with reference to roadmap and architecture docs
    - [ ] Finalize and document agent roles and communication protocols
    - [ ] Mark this item as complete when all sub-items are done
- [x] Draft detailed role descriptions for each agent (PM, TA, DEV, QA, UX)
- [x] Specify agent boundaries and responsibilities
- [x] Draft standardized communication protocols (message formats, API contracts)
- [x] Review and iterate role and protocol drafts
- [x] Finalize and document agent roles and communication protocols
  - API actor definitions, context adaptation, contract testing, intent-aligned endpoints, flexible return shapes, learning/adaptation, documentation standards, and error handling are now implemented.
- [x] Context adaptation proof-of-concept implemented, tested, and documented
- [ ] Establish communication orchestration layer with fallback/escalation
- [ ] Implement basic memory models (short-term, episodic, semantic, procedural)
- [ ] Document priority use cases and "day in the life" scenarios

- [ ] Next: Implement flexible return shapes and advanced error handling patterns

- [ ] Create scope boundaries and change control processes
- [ ] Develop acceptance criteria for agent milestones
- [ ] Set up per-agent success metrics and real-time dashboards

### 2B: Core Capabilities
- [ ] Implement MVP and quick-win features for each agent
- [ ] Develop phased capability rollout and feedback mechanisms (sprints, retros)
- [ ] Build interconnected knowledge networks and Zettelkasten memory
- [ ] Begin regular agent capability reviews with stakeholders

### 2C: Integration and Enhancement
- [ ] Integrate agent communication and shared memory
- [ ] Implement fallback/escalation for agent interaction failures
- [ ] Develop comprehensive testing suite for priority scenarios
- [ ] Map dependencies between agent capabilities and use cases
- [ ] Start automated performance monitoring and improvement plans

### 2D: Optimization and Scaling
- [ ] Optimize agent performance and response times
- [ ] Develop resource capacity/scaling plans and surge documentation
- [ ] Finalize documentation and governance processes
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 3 transition
