# Agent-Team: Autonomous Multi-Agent Backend System

[![CI Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/RhysiiBoy/agent-team/ci.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/RhysiiBoy/agent-team/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Enterprise-Grade, API-First, Backend-Only

---

## Overview

This project implements a robust, modular, and fully autonomous multi-agent development team. See [`ROADMAP_UNIFIED.md`](./ROADMAP_UNIFIED.md) and [`project_architecture.md`](./project_architecture.md) for details. **No frontend, onboarding UI, or platform UI are in scope.**

---

## Key Features & Scope

- **API-First**: All interactions via documented HTTP APIs (`app/`, `api/`)
- **Modular Agents**: PM, TA, DEV, QA, UXâ€”distinct roles and memory models
- **Orchestration Layer**: Central workflow and agent registration via Windsurf (Cascade)
- **Unified Memory**: Vector DB-backed context
- **Event-Driven Messaging**: JSON/Protobuf protocols, async/sync channels
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated, versioned backups
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, property-based, chaos tests

---

## Project Structure

- `app/`: FastAPI app, API endpoints, event handlers
- `agents/`, `api/`: Core agent logic and API contracts
- `scripts/`: ML pipelines, merge drivers, utilities
- `config/`: Feature flags, environment config
- `tests/`: All test suites (`unit/`, `integration/`, `property_based/`, `legacy/`)
- `docs/`: Architecture, protocol, onboarding docs
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD, chaos engineering, validation pipelines

---

## Agent Roles

- **PM Agent**: Project management, coordination, escalation
- **TA Agent**: Technical architecture, design, review
- **DEV Agent**: Implementation, code generation, refactoring
- **QA Agent**: Testing, validation, chaos engineering
- **UX Agent**: Usability, accessibility, user-centric feedback

See [`agent_roles_foundation.md`](./agent_roles_foundation.md) for details.
